A Worldle-inspired game, where you have to guess famous women instead of words. The idea for this game came, when I came across the question: "Which female scientists do you know?", and my answer was: "Marie Curie, ... Marie Curie and hmm... what was her name again? Dorothy Hodgkin..." I considered that a pretty poor performance for a maths student and I thought about a way to improve it. The result is Matildle. Have fun and learn a lot!
